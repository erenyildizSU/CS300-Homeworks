# 📘 CS300 - Data Structures 

This repository includes my assignments from **CS300 - Data Structures**, a core course focusing on advanced data representation, efficient algorithms, and memory-safe programming in C++. Each assignment presented a unique real-world problem and required custom data structure implementations.

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes

- Designed and implemented complex, memory-safe **linked structures**.
- Gained hands-on experience with **Quadtrees**, **2D hybrid lists**, **operator overloading**, and **graph algorithms**.
- Built a solid foundation in **recursive logic**, **pointer arithmetic**, and **graph traversal techniques**.
- Simulated real-world systems such as city proximity queries, job-worker matchings, and dynamic undo operations.

## 📂 Assignment Overview

### 🧠 Homework 1 – Dynamic File-Based Record Management
Implemented a file processing program that dynamically stores and updates client records using **pointer-linked structures**.  
Key highlights:
- Manual memory management
- Insert, delete, and modify operations
- Pointer safety and clean memory deallocation

---

### 🌍 Homework 2 – City Quadtree & Radius Queries
Built a **Point Quadtree** to represent cities in a 2D space.  
Features:
- Recursive quadtree construction
- Pretty-printing of the tree structure
- Radius-based city search with visited node logging
- Parsed input from `cities.txt` and `queries.txt`

### 🧱 Homework 3 – Employee–Project Assignment System
Created a **2D hybrid linked list** to simulate employees and their assigned projects.  
Key functionality:
- Nested linked list design (employee → project)
- Stack-based **undo** operation for deletions
- Full insert/delete/traversal operations
- Modular code structure

---

### 🔗 Homework 4 – Bipartite Graphs & Maximum Matching
Simulated optimal job-worker assignment using a **bipartite graph model**.  
Core implementations:
- Bipartite graph detection
- Maximum matching via augmenting paths
- Dynamic console input with `graph{i}.txt` files
- Adjacency list parsing and validation
